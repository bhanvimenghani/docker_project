Tired of file sharing/sync/cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox? Maybe you want to have more control over your own assets. Why don't you run your own service using ownCloud?
This brief demo will guide you how to run your ownCloud on any server with Containers
Lets first grab some basics. About what is docker and own cloud
Docker
Docker Inc. was founded by Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Pahl .Docker is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
Own cloud
ownCloud is a self-hosted file sync and share server. It provides access to your data through a web interface, sync clients or WebDAV while providing a platform to view, sync and share across devices easily — all under your control.
ownCloud’s open architecture is extensible via a simple but powerful API for applications and plugins and it works with any storage.
